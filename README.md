# Enzymes
This is the perfect place to learn about generalities of enzymes, I offer you a general view of a wide catalog of enzymes important in biological-molecular processes.

#### **ATPases**
Hydrolyze ATP. Many proteins with a wide range of roles have an energy-harnessing ATPase activity as part of their function; for example, motor proteins such as myosin and membrane transport proteins such as the sodium–potassium pump.

#### **GTPases**
Hydrolyze GTP. A large family of GTP-binding proteins are GTPases with central roles in the regulation of cell processes.

#### **Hydrolases**
General term for enzymes that catalyze a hydrolytic cleavage reaction; nucleases and proteases are more specific names for subclasses of these enzymes.

#### **Isomerases**
Catalyze the rearrangement of bonds within a single molecule.

####**Kinases**
Catalyze the addition of phosphate groups to molecules. Protein kinases are an important group of kinases that attach phosphate groups to proteins.

#### **Ligases**
Join together (ligate) two molecules in an energy-dependent process. DNA ligase, for example, joins two DNA molecules together end-to-end through phosphodiester bonds.

#### **Nucleases**
Break down nucleic acids by hydrolyzing bonds between nucleotides. Endo– and exonucleases cleave nucleic acids within and from the ends of the polynucleotide chains, respectively.

#### **Oxido-Reductases**
General name for enzymes that catalyze reactions in which one molecule is oxidized while the other is reduced. Enzymes of this type are often more specifically named oxidases, reductases, or dehydrogenases.

#### **Phosphatases**
Catalyze the hydrolytic removal of a phosphate group from a molecule.

#### **Polymerases**
Catalyze polymerization reactions such as the synthesis of DNA and RNA.

#### **Proteases**
Break down proteins by hydrolyzing bonds between amino acids.

#### **Synthases**
Synthesize molecules in anabolic reactions by condensing two smaller molecules together.

>Typical enzyme names end in "ase," with the exception of the following, which were discovered and named before this convention was generally accepted at the end of the nineteenth century.

#### **Pepsin**
Breaks peptide bonds between amino acids in proteins, especially after aromatic amino acid residues, facilitating protein digestion in the stomach.

#### **Trypsin**
It breaks the peptide bonds that follow the basic amino acids lysine and arginine, aiding in the digestion of proteins in the small intestine.

#### **Thrombin**
It converts fibrinogen to fibrin by cutting its peptide bonds, leading to the formation of a fibrin network that stabilizes the blood clot.

#### **Lysozyme**
It catalyzes the breakdown of glycosidic bonds between the sugars N-acetylmuramic acid and N-acetylglucosamine, weakening the bacterial cell wall and causing lysis of the bacteria.
